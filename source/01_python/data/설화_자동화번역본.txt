Once upon a time, there lived a young man named Potato Doryeong in a mountain village. He is said to have loved potatoes so much that he gave them potatoes for breakfast, potatoes for lunch, and even on dates. One day, a doryeong who was selling French fries at a village marketplace threw potatoes into the sky when there are no customers, and the potatoes hit the passing dragon's nose! The dragon held his nose and came down with thunder and lightning, saying, "Who's bothering my nose!"
The potato master was scared, but soon he passed the fried potatoes to the dragon. As the dragon took a bite, his eyes widened and he said, "What's this! This is the best potato in the world!" So, the dragon rained on the village and gave the master a bag of golden potatoes. Since then, the master has been called the potato king and said to have lived a good life. However, he sometimes looks at the sky and says, "Oh, if I hadn't thrown the potatoes at that time, I wouldn't have been this busy frying potatoes…"" It is said that he grumbled.
